To use, clone the repo and replace String fileName = "day2.txt"; with the path to your file. Each day has a filename path so make sure to change it for each one! For me it also works if the text files are in the root of the directory.

For instance, to run the Day 2 program on my machine, the fileName statement looks like this: fileName = "day2.txt".

Once this is done, you can run the file either using the "run Java" button on whatever IDE you are using. For me, on VSCODE I am able to click "run java" on each class with the addition of the Java extensions.

You can also run it using javac DayTwo.java to compile and then java DayTwo to run it.
